#Factor Management
##Drop Factor Levels

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#First attempt to filter out Oceania from gapminder still retains all five of the

#original continents but produces only 1680 rows of observations which omits the 24

#associated with Oceania

no_ocean <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent != "Oceania")
         
nlevels(no_ocean$continent) 
nrow(no_ocean)   


#We also need to verify the data type of each of the variables to ensure that continent

#and/or country are factors
str(no_ocean)

#Second attempt to only remove unused factor levels, ie unused continents results in

#only four continents to go with the 1680 observations

dropped_ocean <- no_ocean  %>%
    droplevels()

nlevels(dropped_ocean$continent) 
nrow(dropped_ocean) 

  
```

##Reorder Factors
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Order the countries by the standard deviation of the gdpPercap
f_order <- fct_reorder(dropped_ocean$continent, dropped_ocean$gdpPercap, sd)
levels(f_order)

#The results are arranged in ascending order with Africa with the lowest standard

#deviation of gdpPercap and Asia with the highest

```


##Effect of Arranging Variables vs Reordering Factors on Graphs
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#Arrange only orients the values on the y-axis by the increase along gdpPercap
arr_ocean <- dropped_ocean %>%
               group_by(continent) %>%
               summarize(std_gdp=round(sd(gdpPercap), digits=2)) %>%
               arrange(std_gdp) %>%
               ggplot(aes(std_gdp, continent)) + 
               geom_point() + 
               labs(y= "Continent", x="Standard Deviation of GdpPerCap")


#Factoring only orients the values on the y-axis by the country's appearance in the

#list of factors

f_factor <- dropped_ocean %>%
                  group_by(continent) %>%
                  summarize(std_gdp=round(sd(gdpPercap), digits=2)) %>%
                  ggplot(aes(std_gdp, fct_reorder(continent,std_gdp)))+
                  geom_point() + 
                  labs(y= "Continent", x="Standard Deviation of GdpPerCap")


#Arrange the figures in a grid

             widths=c(14, 14),
             top="Comparison of Arrange vs Factoring")


#Combining Arrange and factoring produces the same result as factoring alone, so that

#arrange becomes redundant

arr_and_fac <- dropped_ocean %>%
               group_by(continent) %>%
               summarize(std_gdp=round(sd(gdpPercap), digits=2)) %>%

#Visualization
##with Stacked Chart

#length of the bar and saturation of hue was fully utilized to show the relative

#density of a particular age.

#This chart shows that all countries with an average of 83 can be found in Asia. In

#contrast, all the continents have countries where the average life span is 81 years,

# with Europe having the highest concentration.

```

##with Flipped Bar Charts
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#This aspect of the visualization is based on a task abstraction for an economist who

#wants to see the similarities between countries that have a high gdp per capita and

#have long life expectancies. The suspicion is that the length of the bars may be

#roughly the same for a given country. According to the Fundamental Theory of Accuracy

#in visualization, humans can perceive lengths with high levels of accuracy so an

#economist can quickly ascertain similarities when the charts are compared side by

#side. The chart is also effective because the countries are positioned by the highest

#ranked for population in the channel.

#prosperous. Economies of scale are not being fully realized in Japan and they are not

#as efficient as Norway.

#number of bins only slightly exceeded this at 13. The built-in hues with gapminder

#was utilized instead of the palette from ColorBrewer. A darker background was used for

#more contrast. This chart is more visually appealing in comparison to the earlier

#charts related to factoring with a basic grey background with black dots.
